        <h2>Why Retro PCs Are Back in Style</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, retro PCs have made a surprising comeback among tech enthusiasts and collectors. These machines, once considered outdated, now hold significant nostalgic and historical value. Many users are drawn to the unique design and simplicity of older systems, which offer a glimpse into the evolution of personal computing. What makes them even more appealing is the modern twist—upgraded hardware like SSDs, modern cooling systems, and custom cases are now being integrated into classic shells. This blend of old and new creates a one-of-a-kind computing experience that’s as functional as it is nostalgic. Retro gaming, retro-themed software, and community forums have also fueled this resurgence, allowing users to relive the golden age of computing while enjoying today’s speed and functionality.
